# distance_sparcifier

### Description 
`distance_sparcifier` is a `C++` code to sparcify distance
matrices as a preprocessing step for the computation of sparse
Vietoris-Rips persistence barcodes. The code for reading distance
matrices, the help and the examples are based on
[`Ripser`](https://github.com/Ripser).

Sparcification is based on [Cavanna et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03797). Let P be a furthest point
sampling of a point cloud with insertion radii Î»i. Given an
interleaving constant c of at least 1.0, we sparsify the edge list for the full Rips complex. First let

![p^c(x,y) = \frac{c}{c-1}  \min \{\lambda_x, \lambda_y \}](formulas/pc.png)

and then set the new distances

![d^c(x,y) =
  \begin{cases}
    d(x,y) & \text{if \(d(x,y) \le 2p^c(x,y)\)} \\
    2(d(x,y) - p^c(x,y)) & \text{if \(2p^c(x,y) \le d(x,y) \le (c+1)p^c(x,y)\)}\\
    2 \max_{p, q \in P}{d(p, q)} & \text{otherwise} 
  \end{cases}}

Note that the last term should be infinite, but we use twice the maximum distance because infinity cannot be read by `Ripser`. Using `distance_sparcifier` together with `Ripser` leads to c-interleaved persistence diagrams. Remember to use a threshold between the maximum distance and twice the maximum distance for the sparsification to save time. 

### Building

`distance_sparcifier` requires a C++11 compiler. Here is how to obtain and build `distance_sparcifier`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/blasern/distance_sparcifier
cd distance_sparcifier
make
```

### Use

Here is how to run `distance_sparcifier` and writing the output to a lower distance matrix file:

```sh
./distance_sparcifier --interleaving 1.2 examples/sphere_3_192.lower_distance_matrix > examples/sphere_3_192_sparse_1.2.lower_distance_matrix
./distance_sparcifier --interleaving 2.0 examples/sphere_3_192.lower_distance_matrix > examples/sphere_3_192_sparse_2.0.lower_distance_matrix
./distance_sparcifier --interleaving 5.0 examples/sphere_3_192.lower_distance_matrix > examples/sphere_3_192_sparse_5.0.lower_distance_matrix
```

After this preprocessing step, run `Ripser` as usual: 
```sh
./ripser examples/sphere_3_192.lower_distance_matrix
./ripser examples/sphere_3_192_sparse_1.2.lower_distance_matrix 
./ripser examples/sphere_3_192_sparse_2.0.lower_distance_matrix
./ripser examples/sphere_3_192_sparse_5.0.lower_distance_matrix
```
